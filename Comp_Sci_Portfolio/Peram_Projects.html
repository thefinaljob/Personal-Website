					<h2>Python PIL Project</h2>
					<h4>March 2017</h4>
					<p>This was my first use of a python library in order to create a well functioning program. The purpose of the 
					project was to use image manipulation in order to alter an image and make it unique. Our group decided to go with 
					the idea of making a modern image look antique. In order to achieve this effect, we made the image black and white, 
					lowered the brightness and constrast, added a brown transparent mask, cropped the image and pasted it above a solid color,
					and added a grainy mask on top of the cropped image. This gave the image an antique look, and worked well across a variety of images.

					<h2>Hangman Python Project</h2>
					<h4>February 2017</h4>
					<p>This was my first large application of for loops, arrays, and if statements in a python program. The purpose of the 
					python program was to simulate a hangman game. The game included difficulty levels, a fail state, penalization for wrong
					answers. This was accomplished using array that stored guessed letters, and then it was checked against a string which
					was the correct word. A while loop was used to keep the player included or excluded out of the game. Pictured on the 
					left is the main for loop used in the main hangman function. It I helped code the for 
					loop which made up a large portion of the project, and I overcame problems with variables. One solution that helped me a lot
					was the use of global variables. These types of variables let me use them across various functions. Documentation was not made
					for this project.</p>

					<h2>The College Checklist Protoype</h2>
					<h4>June 2017</h4>
					<p>This project used a typical LAMP stack architecture in order to output college information for a specifc user. It used
					all the elements of the solution stack in order to create a prototype mySQL server stored information regarding college deadlines. 
					The Apache part of the solution allowed for the hosting of the website. The PHP portion of the project allowed for the 
					collection of dates for a specific, for this prototype, it was for user 201.</p>
